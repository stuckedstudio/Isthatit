# Is That It?
![buildstatus](https://travis-ci.org/stuckedstudio/Isthatit.svg?branch=master)

A small, first try, game utilizing SDL, developed on Linux

### What even is this...
- This is a small project serving as my entry point into game development. I want to use this project as a way to really get into how you develop games.

### Why should I care?
- You really shouldn't, but I would be happy to recieve help in the form of pointing out, where my code is terrible (cuz it's going to be...) - I plan on updating this repo every time I make changes until the first release - After that I plan on only releasing full updates.

### Building the program

- It's only been tested on Ubuntu 19.04 and only been tested using the [Quick Cpp Builder](https://github.com/stuckedstudio/quick-cpp-builder) So for higher chance of success I'd recommend using that tool or just g++ with the args specified in the [currentBuildCommand.txt](https://github.com/stuckedstudio/Isthatit/blob/master/currentBuildCommand.txt) file

### Thanks for reading
